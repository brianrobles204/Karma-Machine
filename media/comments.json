He also have thyroid problems also resulting from the Hep C that they refuse to even test for (it&amp;#39;s a very simple blood test).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is at a prison specifically for those needing medical attention, by the way.  There are plenty of other problems there, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest one is that, as soon as someone gets diagnosed with any mental condition, they can expect to spend the rest of the foreseeable future there.  Until doctors say they&amp;#39;re clear to leave, they can&amp;#39;t.  My uncle was on suicide watch over this one guy, for instance.  The guy said voices in his head made him do terrible things.  He&amp;#39;d regularly be &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; to eat his own feces and urine while crying.  He&amp;#39;d already served out his sentence; he was a few years past it.  The thing is: the prison gets just as much money for him as it does for people with physical conditions, only they don&amp;#39;t have to worry about him dying, so they don&amp;#39;t have to treat him.  Thus, they never treat him, and he stays locked in a cell with nothing but a mattress and a toilet under 24/7 surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to visit him a bit ago, and the place looks like shit.  The walls were torn apart, there was no air conditioning anywhere except where guards and visitors stayed, and a ton of other maintenance issues.  The reason was that they had gotten rid of the majority of the maintenance prisoners in favor of medical prisoners, so they could make more money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Murica&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1kpwvw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrgdls", "created": 1377017718.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1376988918.0, "ups": 494, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "pics", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "crovdmndjk5b799bca618326432e4eb072923261be578557b2", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "parent_id": "t1_cbrgizq", "id": "cbrgqaq", "children": ["cbrgqaq"], "name": "t1_cbrgqaq"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "id": "cbrgizq", "gilded": 0, "author": "ne0codex", "parent_id": "t1_cbrf526", "approved_by": null, "body": "Or military", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 4, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or military&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1kpwvw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrgizq", "created": 1377018810.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1376990010.0, "ups": 23, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "pics", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "crovdmndjk5b799bca618326432e4eb072923261be578557b2", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "pics", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "crovdmndjk5b799bca618326432e4eb072923261be578557b2", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "parent_id": "t1_cbrgopu", "children": ["cbrhpr4"], "id": "cbrhpr4", "name": "t1_cbrhpr4"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "id": "cbrgopu", "gilded": 0, "author": "Claviq", "parent_id": "t1_cbrgl07", "approved_by": null, "body": "so thats the true american dream! get yourself to prison and you will live in paradise", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;so thats the true american dream! get yourself to prison and you will live in paradise&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1kpwvw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrgopu", "created": 1377020004.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1376991204.0, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "parent_id": "t1_cbrgl07", "id": "cbrgrie", "children": ["cbrgrie", "cbrgw9v", "cbrhmex"], "name": "t1_cbrgrie"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "id": "cbrgl07", "gilded": 0, "author": "xloadedx", "parent_id": "t1_cbrf526", "approved_by": null, "body": "There's a free gym membership in prison, too.\n\nYou just got swindled federal justice system!", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 7, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a free gym membership in prison, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just got swindled federal justice system!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1kpwvw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrgl07", "created": 1377019228.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1376990428.0, "ups": 21, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "pics", "likes": null, "replies": "", "id": "cbrgmm2", "gilded": 0, "author": "mars20", "parent_id": "t1_cbrf526", "approved_by": null, "body": "But you are not free in prison.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you are not free in prison.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1kpwvw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrgmm2", "created": 1377019562.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1376990762.0, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 81, "parent_id": "t1_cbrf526", "children": ["cbrggie", "cbrgm2f", "cbrh20p", "cbrh24f", "cbrgknb", "cbrggnh", "cbrgjeh", "cbrgksa", "cbrgnqw", "cbrgon6", "cbrgq4f", "cbrgr0v", "cbrgv72", "cbrgwem", "cbrgy7x", "cbrgyiy", "cbrh2dl", "cbrh3yq", "cbrh485", "cbrh7fk", "cbrh871", "cbrh8dj", "cbrh9pu", "cbrhane", "cbrhb5c", "cbrhd2h", "cbrhdjj", "cbrhf1t", "cbrhfip", "cbrhghh", "cbrhhkg", "cbrhhyl", "cbrhi3r", "cbrhjlk", "cbrhk2x", "cbrhko1", "cbrhkqk", "cbrhlnq", "cbrhnie", "cbrhsw9", "cbrhvpx", "cbrhylx", "cbri0io", "cbri1qv", "cbri38y", "cbri475", "cbri4tk", "cbri7vt", "cbri8o3", "cbriaeu", "cbricxg", "cbrid6h", "cbrfk6o", "cbrgim8", "cbrgoi3", "cbrgw04"], "id": "cbrggie", "name": "t1_cbrggie"}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "id": "cbrf526", "gilded": 0, "author": "R88SHUN", "parent_id": "t3_1kpwvw", "approved_by": null, "body": "We have free health care.

I'm English with a Australian wife. We currently live in the UK but recently we lived in Perth, WA for three years. \n\nGrowing up the the UK I'd never ever considered private health care (I mean whats the point?) but when we got to Australia i had to pay each time I wanted to visit the doctors. Everyone was telling me to get private health care which I did. So I shelled out like $100 a month with HBF. \n\nAnyway, one time I got a large cyst growing very quickly on the left side of my neck. So I rush to the doctors who sends me for a biopsy. This all costs me about $600 dollars which I get about 1/2 back from HBF. This in itself is completely new to me - I mean paying for a biopsy! Jesus fucking christ, I mean talk about kicking someone when they are down! \n\nAnyway the biopsy comes back benign which means they just have to remove it and its just a cyst or something (nothing immediately life threatening). So on the advice of my doctor I go to a private hospital to get it removed. At this point it is golf ball sized and growing.  \n\nCool! Glad I had this health insurance after all. So I'm lying on the operating table about to be put under when the insurance guy walks in and says .. \"We are not going to pay for this - its a preexisting condition\". Amazed the 2 doctors in the room say: \"No this is a new condition that needs to be sorted out immediately\". The HBF guys says well we will need to run an enquiry that will take 2 weeks. Otherwise you can pay $8000 now to have it removed. \n\nAt this point I get up of the bed and with the canula still in my arm, I pick up my clothes and get a taxi to a public hospital where I sit in the waiting room for 2 hours. They ended up cutting it out with me awake (local anaesthetic) and send me home within 2 hours of doing it. \n\nIn my opinion this is everything that is wrong with privatising healthcare. Healthcare should never be private it should be provided to anyone who needs it without question. Having a system that even charges a dollar in your biggest times of need is a stone aged concept. \n\nWe live in the UK now and this is one the reasons, because it was too much like the USA.  \n\nps. \n- My father just went through Cancer and is now clear. Cost \u00a30. \n- My son was born on the NHS. Cost \u00a30 \n\nIt costs you $50 just to see a GP in Aus. \n", "edited": 1376991174.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 44, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a story for you.

We currently live in the UK but recently we lived in Perth, WA for three years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up the the UK I&amp;#39;d never ever considered private health care (I mean whats the point?) but when we got to Australia i had to pay each time I wanted to visit the doctors. Everyone was telling me to get private health care which I did. So I shelled out like $100 a month with HBF. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one time I got a large cyst growing very quickly on the left side of my neck. So I rush to the doctors who sends me for a biopsy. This all costs me about $600 dollars which I get about 1/2 back from HBF. This in itself is completely new to me - I mean paying for a biopsy! Jesus fucking christ, I mean talk about kicking someone when they are down! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway the biopsy comes back benign which means they just have to remove it and its just a cyst or something (nothing immediately life threatening). So on the advice of my doctor I go to a private hospital to get it removed. At this point it is golf ball sized and growing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool! Glad I had this health insurance after all. So I&amp;#39;m lying on the operating table about to be put under when the insurance guy walks in and says .. &amp;quot;We are not going to pay for this - its a preexisting condition&amp;quot;. Amazed the 2 doctors in the room say: &amp;quot;No this is a new condition that needs to be sorted out immediately&amp;quot;. The HBF guys says well we will need to run an enquiry that will take 2 weeks. Otherwise you can pay $8000 now to have it removed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I get up of the bed and with the canula still in my arm, I pick up my clothes and get a taxi to a public hospital where I sit in the waiting room for 2 hours. They ended up cutting it out with me awake (local anaesthetic) and send me home within 2 hours of doing it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this is everything that is wrong with privatising healthcare. Healthcare should never be private it should be provided to anyone who needs it without question. Having a system that even charges a dollar in your biggest times of need is a stone aged concept. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We live in the UK now and this is one the reasons, because it was too much like the USA.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ps. \n- My father just went through Cancer and is now clear. Cost \u00a30. \n- My son was born on the NHS. Cost \u00a30 &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It costs you $50 just to see a GP in Aus. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1kpwvw", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cbrgmw4", "created": 1377019621.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1376990821.0, "ups": 220, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "pics", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "crovdmndjk5b799bca618326432e4eb072923261be578557b2", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "pics", "likes": null, "replies": "", "id": "cbrgp2e", "gilded": 0, "author": "Sweetmilk_", "parent_id": "t1_cbrglxv", "approved_by": null, "body": "&gt;every broken bone, every emergency has been treated with speed.\n\nHoly shit.
