However, although organic, the lifespan is significantly longer than humans, and these life forms clearly have other additional abilities (appearing in the form of a human, among other things - more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b) That the life form is from an advanced civilization (&amp;quot;Originally, just a species like yourselves&amp;quot;) much further into their diplomacy than humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c) That there was another life form before this one - eons before this one - that left technology behind that is now being used and built upon by the advanced life form/civilization now speaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;d) That the civilization that this life form is from is a self-proclaimed &amp;quot;curator&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;librarian&amp;quot; of other species.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory, based on this information, is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Elle&amp;#39;s contact with this life form is the first contact of the &amp;quot;mass effect&amp;quot; of which the game derives it&amp;#39;s name. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reminder for those who might have forgotten: Mass Effect is set in the year 2183. Thirty-five years earlier, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of &amp;quot;Citadel space&amp;quot; (from the game&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_(video_game\"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, for those of you thinking, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But humans found technology on mars, which is totally different than the Contact story!&lt;/em&gt; my counter-argument is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The NASA Mars Odyssey Orbiter has been on Mars since 2001, and we&amp;#39;ve had various ongoing missions to Mars since then (not counting satellite missions/fly bys, my research turned up 4). Would it really take 182 years to find something like a mass relay that can wormhole spaceships through space, or an electronic beacon with communication panels still working on it? (The game is not clear what exactly was found, but these seem to be the two main things that have been found to connect the organic species on the Citadel together.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that this was the next for the &amp;quot;small steps&amp;quot; mentioned to Elle&amp;#39;s character when she goes through the wormhole. First contact is this personal, individual experience. Then, they watch and see how we react to that (or some species, it seems, no longer wish to contact the outside life forms - Note the dialogue: ELLE &amp;quot;So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?&amp;quot; TED Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams. Some never make it this far.&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because this species live some much longer than us, a few hundred years wouldn&amp;#39;t be that big of a deal to wait (although it&amp;#39;s a long time to humans). After a few hundred years, they drop off a piece of technology on a familiar planet, where they know we are looking and will find it (just like they echo&amp;#39;d our transmission from nearby Vega, where they knew we could track it). And voila! Step two is complete, and humans become integrated into the Citadel society...although it was supposed to be slower, but humans, being how we are, keep trying to aggressively push it faster (hence the social/political problems of the Mass Effect games).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More details:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that the life form that Elle is speaking to is an Asari. Here&amp;#39;s why:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The life form talks about finding the technology and being the first to get in touch with the other species. This is the history of the Asari in the Mass Effect games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The life form refers to itself as a curator/librarian figure of the other life forms, which is how Asari seem to think of themselves in the Mass Effect games. Being one of the oldest, wisest, and the first species to find Prothean technology, they seek to understand and find a special place for all species in the culture of the Citadel (although &amp;quot;few seek to understand them&amp;quot; laments Liara). This characteristic is personified through Liara, who is an archaeologist seeking to understand even the Protheans, who died out 50k years ago (and left all the technology of the comm beacons, mass relays, etc that all intergalactic society is built on - or so we think at the beginning of the game). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asari have no gender and have the ability to go into other species&amp;#39; minds. What was seen by Elle could be the experience of having an Asari in your mind, pulling from memories. Appearing as male would not feel foreign or unusual to a species that is naturally gender neutral. Additionally, the ability to pull from another creature&amp;#39;s mind is used to ease there pain and help them feel comfortable, which seems to be an overall trait of the Asari people - we see it in the Consort and also with Liara in Mass Effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asari live for hundreds of years. Even 200 years old is considered &amp;quot;barely older than a child&amp;quot; in Asari culture. This fits with how the life form from Vega talks about time and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The found technology spoken of would, of course, be the found Prothean relays and the Citadel itself &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elle&amp;#39;s headset recorded 16 hours of static even though her drop was only a few seconds long. This could account for how long Citadel life has existed, or some minor differences/flux in time. However, I feel like in general, Citadel life is still getting figured out in the first game - different species are still vying for a spot in different trade organizations and for power and in general seem disgrunted and dissatisfied...something that might be from it staying unchanged for a long time, but could be because it&amp;#39;s been just long enough to want change. The sensation of &amp;quot;long enough&amp;quot; is also very relative depending on species lifespan, which is hit on in Mass Effect due to humans&amp;#39; short life span. Another way the time issue could be explained is that the wormholes have something to do with it - but I&amp;#39;ll leave that to you more science-minded folk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "(I know that the movie *Contact* is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name, but since my evidence is from the movie script, and since I haven't read the book version of *Contact*, I'm not assuming my evidence works for both.

Another way the time issue could be explained is that the wormholes have something to do with it - but I'll leave that to you more science-minded folk.", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "saved": false, "id": "1me99s", "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "BruceWayneIsBarman", "media": null, "score": 186, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2u6rc", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 71, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/FanTheories/comments/1me99s/video_game_mass_effect_is_the_sequel_to_the_movie/", "name": "t3_1me99s", "created": 1379220600.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1me99s/video_game_mass_effect_is_the_sequel_to_the_movie/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Video game \"Mass Effect\" is the sequel to the movie \"Contact\"", "created_utc": 1379191800.0, "link_flair_text": null, "ups": 257, "num_comments": 11, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.AskMen", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "AskMen", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been hanging out with a guy.

You can do it!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke reappeared out of the water, got on his feet and took a few steps further towards the beach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGot it!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turned around to throw the ball. His arm swung back, then in our direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he screamed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFuck!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ball ended somewhere half-way between Luke and us. Luke stumbled backwards out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kiel stood in place but I took a few steps towards Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s a guy here! There\u2019s a fucking dead guy!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the corner of my eye I saw the orange trunks fall into the water. Kiel ran towards the beach and I followed his example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke had already reached the sand and was walking further back. We ran towards him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a body in the water; a man. Long and thin. Face down and naked. With pale, nearly bluish skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d said Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe should call the cops,\u201d said Kiel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe should pull him out.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouldn\u2019t have said that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou do!\u201d said Kiel. \u201cI\u2019m not going to touch a dead guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFuck,\u201d said Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBut,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to pull him out.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFuck,\u201d screamed Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo way,\u201d said Kiel. \u201cI\u2019m going to call the cops.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke ran into the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d he screamed. \u201cHe\u2019s moving!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in that moment I saw it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The right arm raised lightly out of the water, then plunged back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke was already four steps in the water when the left arm too rose out of the water, then plunged back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran after Luke, right into the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke grabbed the man\u2019s hand and pulled him forward. I splashed towards them. Jointly we pulled his upper body out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heavy; cold and slippery skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt his muscles move in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cTo the beach!\u201d screamed Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man let out a rattling cough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We pulled him towards the sand; our feet slipping and fighting against the water and his cold arms slipping through our fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFuck,\u201d said Luke. \u201cI hope Kiel is getting the ambulance.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kiel was on the beach, running towards our bags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man was coughing water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in that moment, with the panic setting in, I noticed something oily on my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were wheezing. My foot reached the sand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe have to turn him to his side,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSure,\u201d said Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We pulled the man another few steps up on the sand, then, carefully, Luke lowered the arm he was holding and I pulled my side of his body up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His body was turned to the side, but his head was still hanging limply down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you okay man?\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one fast motion his head turned towards me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly blue, shiny skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No skin around his chin, just bare teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFuck!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His body slammed back into the sand and I stumbled backwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d screamed Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFuck man! His eyes are all black!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Black eyeballs. Not gray. Not white with a large black center. All a deep, shiny black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke tried to turn the man on his back but struggled with the slippery body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFuck, Luke, get away!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave his face in the sand.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cGet away!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one quick movement Luke rolled the heavy body on its back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he too screamed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyes, but no nose. Just large teeth and skin wrapped tightly over bone. Pale, nearly blue skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s jaw was opening and closing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke was stumbling backwards; fell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke screamed and kicked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s right hand was wrapped around Luke\u2019s leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s head turned to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke screamed for help and I just stood there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the man\u2019s other arm rose from the sand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke kicked sand towards him. Still screamed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLet me go! Get him off! Fucking get him off!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man rolled on his side and his other hand grabbed for Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke pulled his leg away and the man missed. Luke kicked for the hand and the hand grabbed his second leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was running forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFucking help me!\u201d screamed Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man breathed a rattling cough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My foot hit his back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pain in my toes. Something in his body cracked. My foot slipped off his back and I barely caught my balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man coughed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His hands were still wrapped around Luke\u2019s legs and Luke was grabbing sand and throwing it into his face and hit with his fists against the hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s legs started moving. Slowly; like snakes wriggling from side to side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s pulling me in!\u201d screamed Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s legs moved faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kicked against his head and screamed from the pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man made another rattling sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His feet disappeared in the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFucking help me!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kicked his head again but the man didn\u2019t seem to notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His knees touched the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I punched against his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke kicked but his feet got nowhere and he tried to punch the man, but the man was pulling him too fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His black eyes seemed to be on me and on Luke and on everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I punched against his teeth. His teeth opened and tried to grab my finger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled my hand away just in time; fell backwards too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s hip reached the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke was crying between his screams and throwing sand towards that face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw Kiel coming closer; running full-speed towards the man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pushed back towards my feet and tried to kick his eyes, but I missed and slipped off his head and fell back into the sand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke was clawing and trying to grab the sand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s chest reached the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I jumped back to my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke\u2019s feet reached the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran behind Luke and pushed my arms under his shoulders. His hands grabbed mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled, but Luke\u2019s knees disappeared in the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We screamed and pulled and the man\u2019s bare, large teeth only seemed to grin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man\u2019s shoulders reached the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke\u2019s hip reached the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kiel\u2019s scream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kiel\u2019s body crunched against the man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kiel, with his huge mass, lying on the man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the man bit deep into his chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Kiel screamed even louder than Luke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the man\u2019s head shook from side to side and left a bleeding hole in Kiel\u2019s chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that moment, with my arms under Luke\u2019s and my feet dug deep into the sand and Luke\u2019s scream and Kiel\u2019s scream and the man\u2019s bloody grin I saw another pale hand in the water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A pale hand that grabbed the man\u2019s leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he slipped away under Kiel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there was a loud crack and Luke let out a scream I will never forget and Luke was jerked from my arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We tried to grab his hands, but he was gone so quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ran into the water, but we didn\u2019t see him anymore. I\u2019m ashamed of that, but Kiel saw some movement, some pale color, but it didn\u2019t look like Luke and we quickly ran back out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stood there, with our eyes towards the water and Kiel\u2019s hand on his bleeding chest, and we cried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ambulance arrived. We screamed something about Luke being pulled into the water and a pale, naked man pulling him inside. They called for divers and tried to treat Kiel\u2019s wound, but he didn\u2019t let them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police came a few minutes later; the coastguard took another twenty or so minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two divers; later another four. Several black rubber boats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They searched until the late afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing they found were orange swimming trunks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://facebook.com/is.Anton.Lesch\"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;^&lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/AntonScheller\"&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It happened exactly four years ago and I still have panic attacks every time that I get too close to a beach.\n\nThere were three of us: Luke, Kiel and me.

The trunks were still in his hand.\n\n\u201cCool, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d I said. \u201cYou forgot the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can just make a ball out of these.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on Kiel,\u201d said Luke. \u201cGet that damn ball.\u201d\n\nKiel threw the swimming trunks towards Luke.\n\n\u201cWho needs a ball when you have trunks!\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck that,\u201d said Luke.\n\n\u201cYou go!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn lazy.\u201d\n\nKiel laughed.\n\n\u201cShow what you got, Mr. Slim!\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\nLuke plunged into the warm sea water and swam towards where Luke had left the ball. Kiel laughed.\n\n\u201cGo Luke, fetch! You can do it!\u201d\n\nLuke reappeared out of the water, got on his feet and took a few steps further towards the beach.\n\n\u201cGot it!\u201d\n\nHe turned around to throw the ball. His arm swung back, then in our direction.\n\nThen he screamed.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d\n\nThe ball ended somewhere half-way between Luke and us. Luke stumbled backwards out of the water.\n\nKiel stood in place but I took a few steps towards Luke.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a guy here! There\u2019s a fucking dead guy!\u201d\n\nIn the corner of my eye I saw the orange trunks fall into the water. Kiel ran towards the beach and I followed his example.\n\nLuke had already reached the sand and was walking further back. We ran towards him.\n\nThere was a body in the water; a man. Long and thin. Face down and naked. With pale, nearly bluish skin.\n\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d said Luke.\n\n\u201cWe should call the cops,\u201d said Kiel.\n\n\u201cWe should pull him out.\u201d\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have said that.\n\n\u201cYou do!\u201d said Kiel. \u201cI\u2019m not going to touch a dead guy.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d said Luke.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have to pull him out.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d screamed Luke.\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d said Kiel. \u201cI\u2019m going to call the cops.\u201d\n\nLuke ran into the water.\n\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d he screamed. \u201cHe\u2019s moving!\u201d\n\nAnd in that moment I saw it too.\n\nThe right arm raised lightly out of the water, then plunged back in.\n\nLuke was already four steps in the water when the left arm too rose out of the water, then plunged back in.\n\nI ran after Luke, right into the water.\n\nLuke grabbed the man\u2019s hand and pulled him forward. I splashed towards them. Jointly we pulled his upper body out of the water.\n\nHeavy; cold and slippery skin.\n\nI felt his muscles move in my hands.\n\n\u201cTo the beach!\u201d screamed Luke.\n\nThe man let out a rattling cough.\n\nWe pulled him towards the sand; our feet slipping and fighting against the water and his cold arms slipping through our fingers.\n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d said Luke. \u201cI hope Kiel is getting the ambulance.\u201d\n\nKiel was on the beach, running towards our bags.\n\nThe man was coughing water.\n\nEven in that moment, with the panic setting in, I noticed something oily on my fingers.\n\nWe were wheezing. My foot reached the sand.\n\n\u201cWe have to turn him to his side,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Luke.\n\nWe pulled the man another few steps up on the sand, then, carefully, Luke lowered the arm he was holding and I pulled my side of his body up.\n\nHis body was turned to the side, but his head was still hanging limply down.\n\n\u201cAre you okay man?\u201d I said.\n\nIn one fast motion his head turned towards me.\n\nNearly blue, shiny skin.\n\nNo skin around his chin, just bare teeth.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d\n\nHis body slammed back into the sand and I stumbled backwards.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d screamed Luke.\n\n\u201cFuck man! His eyes are all black!\u201d\n\nBlack eyeballs. Not gray. Not white with a large black center. All a deep, shiny black.\n\nLuke tried to turn the man on his back but struggled with the slippery body.\n\n\u201cFuck, Luke, get away!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave his face in the sand.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet away!\u201d\n\nIn one quick movement Luke rolled the heavy body on its back.\n\nThen he too screamed.\n\nEyes, but no nose. Just large teeth and skin wrapped tightly over bone. Pale, nearly blue skin.\n\nThe man\u2019s jaw was opening and closing.\n\nLuke was stumbling backwards; fell.\n\nLuke screamed and kicked.\n\nThe man\u2019s right hand was wrapped around Luke\u2019s leg.\n\nThe man\u2019s head turned to Luke.\n\nLuke screamed for help and I just stood there.\n\nThen the man\u2019s other arm rose from the sand.\n\nLuke kicked sand towards him. Still screamed.\n\n\u201cLet me go! Get him off! Fucking get him off!\u201d\n\nThe man rolled on his side and his other hand grabbed for Luke.\n\nLuke pulled his leg away and the man missed. Luke kicked for the hand and the hand grabbed his second leg.\n\nI was running forward.\n\n\u201cFucking help me!\u201d screamed Luke.\n\nThe man breathed a rattling cough.\n\nMy foot hit his back.\n\nPain in my toes. Something in his body cracked. My foot slipped off his back and I barely caught my balance.\n\nThe man coughed.\n\nHis hands were still wrapped around Luke\u2019s legs and Luke was grabbing sand and throwing it into his face and hit with his fists against the hands.\n\nThe man\u2019s legs started moving. Slowly; like snakes wriggling from side to side.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pulling me in!\u201d screamed Luke.\n\nThe man\u2019s legs moved faster.\n\nI kicked against his head and screamed from the pain.\n\nThe man made another rattling sound.\n\nHis feet disappeared in the water.\n\n\u201cFucking help me!\u201d\n\nI kicked his head again but the man didn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\nHis knees touched the water.\n\nI punched against his face.\n\nLuke kicked but his feet got nowhere and he tried to punch the man, but the man was pulling him too fast.\n\nHis black eyes seemed to be on me and on Luke and on everything.\n\nI punched against his teeth. His teeth opened and tried to grab my finger. \n\nI pulled my hand away just in time; fell backwards too.\n\nThe man\u2019s hip reached the water.\n\nLuke was crying between his screams and throwing sand towards that face.\n\nI saw Kiel coming closer; running full-speed towards the man.\n\nI pushed back towards my feet and tried to kick his eyes, but I missed and slipped off his head and fell back into the sand.\n\nLuke was clawing and trying to grab the sand.\n\nThe man\u2019s chest reached the water.\n\nI jumped back to my feet.\n\nLuke\u2019s feet reached the water.\n\nI ran behind Luke and pushed my arms under his shoulders. His hands grabbed mine.\n\n I pulled, but Luke\u2019s knees disappeared in the water.\n\nWe screamed and pulled and the man\u2019s bare, large teeth only seemed to grin.\n\nThe man\u2019s shoulders reached the water.\n\nLuke\u2019s hip reached the water.\n\nKiel\u2019s scream.\n\nKiel\u2019s body crunched against the man.\n\nKiel, with his huge mass, lying on the man.\n\nAnd the man bit deep into his chest.\n\nAnd Kiel screamed even louder than Luke.\n\nAnd the man\u2019s head shook from side to side and left a bleeding hole in Kiel\u2019s chest.\n\nIn that moment, with my arms under Luke\u2019s and my feet dug deep into the sand and Luke\u2019s scream and Kiel\u2019s scream and the man\u2019s bloody grin I saw another pale hand in the water.\n\nA pale hand that grabbed the man\u2019s leg.\n\nAnd he slipped away under Kiel.\n\nAnd there was a loud crack and Luke let out a scream I will never forget and Luke was jerked from my arms.\n\nWe tried to grab his hands, but he was gone so quick.\n\nWe ran into the water, but we didn\u2019t see him anymore. I\u2019m ashamed of that, but Kiel saw some movement, some pale color, but it didn\u2019t look like Luke and we quickly ran back out.\n\nWe stood there, with our eyes towards the water and Kiel\u2019s hand on his bleeding chest, and we cried.\n\nThe ambulance arrived. We screamed something about Luke being pulled into the water and a pale, naked man pulling him inside. They called for divers and tried to treat Kiel\u2019s wound, but he didn\u2019t let them.\n\nThe police came a few minutes later; the coastguard took another twenty or so minutes.\n\nTwo divers; later another four. Several black rubber boats.\n\nThey searched until the late afternoon.\n\nThe only thing they found were orange swimming trunks.\n\n[^](http://facebook.com/is.Anton.Lesch)\\^[^](http://twitter.com/AntonScheller)", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "saved": false, "id": "1megg9", "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "urban_teller", "media": null, "score": 98, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm4d", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 28, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/nosleep/comments/1megg9/washed_up/", "name": "t3_1megg9", "created": 1379227363.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1megg9/washed_up/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Washed Up", "created_utc": 1379198563.0, "link_flair_text": null, "ups": 126, "num_comments": 10, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "news.nationalpost.com", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "math", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "secure_media": null, "saved": false, "id": "1mew2n", "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "author": "tpk1024", "media": null, "score": 43, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "http://e.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rJRTMoIT91Jmbwrp.jpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0n", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 11, "is_self": false, "permalink": "/r/math/comments/1mew2n/frustrated_professors_convince_elementary_schools/", "name": "t3_1mew2n", "created": 1379242302.0, "url": "http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/09/13/frustrated-professors-convince-schools-to-step-back-from-new-math-and-go-back-to-basics/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Frustrated professors convince elementary schools to step back from \u2018new math\u2019 and go \u2018back to basics\u2019", "created_utc": 1379213502.0, "link_flair_text": null, "ups": 54, "num_comments": 31, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.AskWomen", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why women say this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little background - I&amp;#39;m 21(m), my best friend is male and every other friend I have is female.
