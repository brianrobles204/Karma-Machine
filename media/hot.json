At the time of this story, she was looking for her first apartment and moving out from her parents&amp;#39; house. Her and my brother didn&amp;#39;t want to move in together since they had only dated for a few months. She opted instead to search for a roommate online. Browsing Craigslist, she found an ad titled something like &amp;quot;Roommate Wanted: Females Only.&amp;quot; This sort of thing was common since the area she was looking in was mostly young professionals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The listing was for a room in a house for about $225 a month, which was quite cheap compared to the most places listed. The occupant listed herself as a 23 year old college student that wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable with living with any males. The other roommate would have their own room and attached bathroom. So far, Amanda was into this place. However, the listing only had a single photo from outside the property. Amanda sent an email wanting to meet the occupant and tour the house. Within 30 minutes, she receives an email back with all the details and time to stop by. The girl worked late hours and wanted Amanda to stop by at 8pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Amanda arrives, there is a handwritten note on the front door saying &amp;quot;Door broken, use back door.&amp;quot; Walking around the house, it looks nice but slightly unkempt: tall grass, weeds, dusty windows, etc. Still no alarms for Amanda though. When she knocks on the backdoor and an older man opens the door. At first Amanda thinks she has the wrong house but the man reassures her and says that the occupant (I forget the name) was out and he was the landlord. The occupant asked him to meet Amanda since she was working late. He seemed pleasant and offered to show her around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alarms start going off but aren&amp;#39;t at red alert yet. First, the guy was clearly in his 40&amp;#39;s, unshaven, and looked like he lived in his car. Also, only the kitchen light was on. As they walked around the house, Amanda noticed one huge red flag: No furniture. Nothing. The landlord was polite about answering questions but seemed irritable to keeping lights on for too long, rushing her around and only letting her look at rooms for a few moments. There was a single room that the landlord wouldn&amp;#39;t open, telling her that it was the occupant&amp;#39;s room and he didn&amp;#39;t want to invade her privacy. As they walk down the hallway into the living room, she notices the front door has a plank nailed across it. &amp;quot;Broken&amp;quot; for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amanda&amp;#39;s creep-o-meter is started to ding so she decides to wrap up the walk-through and leave but trying to polite. As she&amp;#39;s giving the guy her &amp;quot;thanks for the showing&amp;quot; bit, he perks up and states that he forgot to show her the basement. It&amp;#39;s recently furnished and would be a great rec room...and she should take a look down there. At the time, Amanda and the landlord are standing in the small hallway between the front living room and the back kitchen. In this little hallway was the basement door. When he opens the door, it opens outward to create something of a barrier between Amanda and the backdoor. The basement is pitch black. He smiles, motions down the stairs, and says &amp;quot;Ladies first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens next is nothing more than a stroke of luck. Amanda get a text just as some random person parks in front of the house. Thinking on her feet, she pretends it&amp;#39;s a phone call and answers her phone. &amp;quot;Hey! Yeah, are you here? I&amp;#39;ll come out from around back and let you in. It&amp;#39;s great, you have to see it.&amp;quot; With a motion of confidence, she excuses herself around the landlord and walks out of the back door. She says the guy just looked at her like he was confused. Once outside, she sprinted to her car and sped like hell out of there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Amanda got home, she told her mother and my brother everything.

The Craigslist post had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EPILOGUE &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The house had been foreclosed over six months earlier and the property had been abandoned. When the police investigated, they found that the closed room the &amp;quot;landlord&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t want her to look in was where the man had been staying. There was a pile of old dirty blankets, rotten food, and empty gallon jugs everywhere. More creepy was he had plastered ripped up pages from porno mags on ALL the walls in the room (where do they even find porno mags!?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The really scary part of this was the basement.

To me she had always been aunt Kirah, never nurse Kirah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe world just disappeared,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like there was only you and me and my whole life seemed to have led to that moment.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She took a bite of the fairy cake and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s strange, but I don\u2019t even remember moving my fingers or giving you mouth-to-mouth. I just wanted to save you and in that moment nothing else mattered, not even my own life. I just knew you would live.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cEven when everyone told you to stop?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kirah nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cEven then. I knew that you would live and I would have done anything just to make you take that first breath.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThank you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m happy that I did. Make sure you bring good to the world.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three days after my sixteenth birthday I announced to my parents that I would become a nurse. By the time I turned seventeen they had convinced me to become a doctor instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Studying medicine was the most difficult time of my life - or at least the most difficult time that I remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I gave them a tour of the grounds my parents had never even entered a lecture hall. They had supported me in school, but universit was different and when my trouble with deadlines and stacks of learn-this-by-heart sheets started they didn\u2019t know how to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aunt Kirah did know. She came and showed me the best books. She taught me mnemonics for the most important bones and muscles. She even taught me how to take proper notes and where to sit in the lecture hall - not in the first two or three rows so you don\u2019t get picked on, but in the first third of the hall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe ones in the back,\u201d Kirah said, \u201cAre either shy or don\u2019t want to listen. As a doctor you shouldn\u2019t be shy and as a smart girl you should want to listen. It\u2019s not cool to sit in the back. It\u2019s the seats of those that want to chat and gossip or sleep. It\u2019s the seats of those that want to fail and it\u2019s not cool to fail.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would be lying if I said my grades were great. But I never failed an exam and my grades were high enough that, when my first placement went well, they allowed me to join the neonatology specialisation. It felt like the right thing to do, the right thing to give back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I graduated I had three parents to watch my hat fly. There were my parents, of course, and aunt Kirah sat to the left of my mom with a big smile on her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kirah also helped me get my first job - in her hospital. In the hospital in which I was born dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She showed me the way around and introduced me to the other nurses. Aunt Kirah told me how to learn the most and how to handle those wrinkly, small and fragile humans with care, but she also scolded me with her soft voice whenever I handled a newborn too roughly or made decisions that she thought were not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just for one year I had that pleasure. I wish I would have thanked her more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctor\u2019s life is hard. You have to be calm and compassionate to your patients all day. That life doesn\u2019t allow you to take rest and think of yourself. But most of all it doesn\u2019t give you time to sit back and see all the other people in your life that would need your compassion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew that her husband had died long ago, but aunt Kirah never wore a sad face. I also heard the rumors but with my thoughts on the patients I quickly discarded those words from my mental stack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUnhappy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMiscarried.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cLonely.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCan\u2019t have children.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlways just at work.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always asked her how she was and she always said she was fine. A whole year and I didn\u2019t listen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was standing behind me while I was giving advice to a soon-to-be mother. I felt her hand on my shoulder and then she pulled it away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c... and we even offer a water birth, if \u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The patient turned white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh my god,\u201d the patient said. \u201cOh my god.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A \u201cWhat?\u201d left my mouth but before she could answer I heard the heavy thud behind me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aunt Kirah\u2019s arms and legs were twitching, then cramped. Her lower jaw was pulled down and her eyes turned inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seizure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We gave her muscle relaxants but her mouth never closed again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kirah was in that bed for a week. There were so many flowers that even the second table didn\u2019t suffice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were always people in her room, holding her hand and saying kind words. Only when I said that I was a doctor and needed privacy, then they would leave and I would sit down and cry with my head on her chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she fell her head had hit the floor. An aneurysm. Brain dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn\u2019t paid attention to that hand on my shoulder; to that hand pulling on my coat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a week her doctor made the decision to pull the plug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked at her face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know she\u2019s dead already.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That afternoon my parents came. Kirah\u2019s sister and her two nephews too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One after the other a slow procession of nurses and doctors went through the room to squeeze her hand or kiss her forehead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All except my parents and her sister and nephews left. I was the one that pulled the plug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no sound like that steady, long beep. No sound where you hope so much that it would sound different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week later I emptied her locker. Another nurse, one around Kirah\u2019s age, came into the room while I was folding a blue sweater.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nurse looked around the room, then quickly approached me. She held a file towards me. It had Kirah\u2019s name on it and a patient number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t give this out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think you might want it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhy?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou will see.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night, with the basket of Kirah\u2019s possessions on a chair and a glass of sour white wine on the table, I opened that file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were not many pages of the first years. Just her profile and insurance data. A few standard tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a stone in my stomach when I saw the pregnancy test. Positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were several more lab results. An admission sheet. One word was scribbed in red letters at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMiscarriage.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My training took over. I looked through the data on the page and didn\u2019t find a cause. For nearly half an hour I read through the sheet and the lab results stapled to the yellow cardboard. All results seemed fine. She had been admitted in the afternoon with pain and bleeding, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was an operation report too. They removed her uterus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sank the file on the table and felt tears roll down my cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had never listened. I had never wondered why she was alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why she had always cared for me so much. She had saved me. She had given life to me. I had been her replacement child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took the glass and raised it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI would have done anything just to make you take that first breath,\u201d she had said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was in that moment, when my eyes were somewhere on the ceiling and the cold of the glass touched my lips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The page had turned back to the page with the red letters at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes moved back to the page. I looked at the large scribbled word with the capital M. My eyes moved down the page. Then I saw the date.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My birthday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "On my sixteenth birthday, just after I had blown out the candles on a fairy cake, my mother told me that I was born dead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy that you made it,\u201d she said.\n\nI pulled the fork out of my mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess we never told you. If not for aunt Kirah you wouldn\u2019t even have made it through your first day.\u201d\n\nAunt Kirah. Nurse Kirah.\n\nMy mother\u2019s contractions started in her lunch break, two months early. She was at the hospital twenty minutes later and another hour after that she pushed my head out of her body.\n\nLike most babies, I didn\u2019t breathe. The doctor gave me a light slap, like for all babies. Another light slap, like for some babies. Then a stronger slap.\n\nAt that point my mother started screaming. A thick stream of blood ran out of her lower body. The doctor handed me over to a young nurse who tried another slap and then quickly passed me on to a 24 year old nurse. Nurse Kirah.\n\nKirah wrapped her mouth around mine and blew air into my nose. She used two of her fingers to quickly massage my chest. She paused, blew another gust of air into my lungs and kept massaging. Over and over again.\n\nMy mother stopped screaming. They managed to stop her bleeding too.\n\nThey told nurse Kirah to stop the cpr. They said it was hopeless. The doctor tried to pull her hand away from my small and still chest.

There are also various other features steam offers like badges, cards and many other things which make it a very enjoyable experience! Of course there are many games which are not supported by steam too..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/vwMin.jpg\"&gt;Last month also featured the annual steam sale!&lt;/a&gt; This is the annual time when the games are sold at the cheapest on steam. I am a big fan of it and here&amp;#39;s the list of games i bought...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Age of empires 2 HD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dues Ex&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Just cause&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tomb raider&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CS:GO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fallout: New vegas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dishonoured&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alan wake&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far i am in love with all of them and dont regret any of them! (except Fallout: New vegas which makes my computer hang :( ... i need to do something about it.. ) Anyway Steam really revolutionized PC gaming and is fucking awesome! I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to start pc gaming!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked around this subreddit and people seem really helpful. Especially during the steam sale i dont know what i would have done if not for this sub. I am really grateful to them.  So i decided to feature this awesome place and Here&amp;#39;s an awesome interview with the mods!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;1. What motivated you to create/moderate this sub ?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;timbro1:&lt;/strong&gt;  I have been a supporter of gaming communities for a number of years, and I am addicted to Reddit so it was an easy fit.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;dihydrogen_monoxide:&lt;/strong&gt;  At the time, there were only 3 moderators and I saw areas that I could assist in with CSS and spam queues. I applied for the gig and it&amp;#39;s been a wild ride since.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Cheesydude:&lt;/strong&gt;  I messaged a stylesheet fix a while back to the mods, had a discussion with Tim and began creating a new stylesheet for the subreddit. I enjoy improving my own CSS skills as well as improving the subreddit&amp;#39;s looks - I also enjoy helping to keep the quality of this subreddit up by clearing out spam whenever I see it.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Reiniger:&lt;/strong&gt;  I am a big advocate and fan of Steam and all the things Valve does so I thought it would be a no brainer to get involved with Steam in some way. I found out about this subreddit and put my name in to moderate. The rest is history.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Kuiper:&lt;/strong&gt;  Back in 2008 and 2009, I was a petty active user on SPUF (the official Steam Powered User Forums). In the time that I was active on SPUF, I watched the level of activity there blossom somewhat explosively. And with the increased volume of traffic came a severe reduction in signal/noise ratio that eventually drove me away. I don&amp;#39;t blame the moderation team or the new users themselves for the degredation in quality of experience at SPUF; I believe that the phenomenon I observed was a result of the platform. Fundamentally, &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; style bulliten boards like vBulliten don&amp;#39;t scale well beyond a certain level of traffic. When you have dozens and potentially hundreds of new posts every hour, it&amp;#39;s often difficult and time-consuming to navigate and follow discussions, and with that increased friction comes a decrease in the level of meaningful discussion. What I find exciting about a platform like reddit is that it does scale well\u2014the fact that you can have &amp;quot;threads&amp;quot; with hundreds or even thousands of posts within the span of several hours on a single topic and still achieve something resembling cogent discussion is pretty amazing to me. So in a lot of ways, I think I see &lt;a href=\"/r/steam\"&gt;/r/steam&lt;/a&gt; as an opportunity to succeed in places where I felt that SPUF didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;2. The steam sale just ended .. did you buy any ? which ones ?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;timbro1:&lt;/strong&gt;  Prison Architect, Towns, Under the Ocean, Gunpoint, Kerbal Space Program, Triple Town, Surgeon Simulator &amp;amp; Dragon Age. So far my favourite games of the bunch are Kerbal Space Program, Surgeon Simulator and Prison Architect.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;dihydrogen_monoxide:&lt;/strong&gt;  Tomb Raider, Cthulhu Saves the World &amp;amp; Breath of Death, Valve Complete pack. Someone gifted me System Shock 2 and Monaco. I bought Ys and Giana Sisters the day after the sale.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Cheesydude:&lt;/strong&gt;  This year I already had most of the games I wanted, I managed to spend less than $15 on three games - Just Cause, Call of Juarez:Gunslinger &amp;amp; McPixel. Steam sales become less exciting the more games you have in your library, in my opinion. It would be good to get the achievement hunt back :)&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Reiniger:&lt;/strong&gt;  Oh gosh, too many. Lets see, there is: Fallout: New Vegas, The Cave, Assasin&amp;#39;s Creed: Revelations, Sword of the Stars; The Pit, Monaco, Torchlight II, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Batman Arkham City, LEGO Lord of the Rings, Tropico 4, Organ Trail, Rues, Castle Crashers, Max Payne 3, Dishonored, Indie Game: The Movie, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Bully, FTL, and Don&amp;#39;t Starve&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Kuiper:&lt;/strong&gt;  In the recent summer sale, I chose to spend my money on smaller/shorter games that I knew I would be able to find time to play and finish. (I&amp;#39;d rather buy a short game and spend a few hours playing it than buy a 30-hour game and spend zero hours playing it, which is what often seems to happen in big sales like this.) In order of when I bought them, the games I purchased were Starseed Pilgrim, Little Inferno, Legend of Grimrock, FEZ, The Swapper, Poker Night 2, Half-Minute Hero, The Knife Of Dunwall DLC for Dishonored, and several DLC packs for Defense Grid. I already owned Noitu Love 2, but I love that game so I bought several extra copies to give away and gift to friends. Oh, and I also just picked up Kentucky Route Zero in the daily sale that came right after.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;3. How much are you involved in steam ?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;timbro1:&lt;/strong&gt; I have been on Steam going back to my Counter-Strike 1.6 days. I am also the curator of the reddit group on Steam.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;dihydrogen_monoxide:&lt;/strong&gt;  Pretty involved I suppose, I&amp;#39;ve had an account for 9 years (about to get my 10 year badge!)&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Cheesydude:&lt;/strong&gt;  If my computer is turned on, i&amp;#39;m probably on steam. In comparison to other game store clients (e.g. Uplay) it&amp;#39;s amazing - it has almost everything I want in a client and it makes it easy to organize everything. I&amp;#39;m an avid fan of the screenshot function, i&amp;#39;ve got around 1,600 screenshots uploaded on my steam profile.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Reiniger:&lt;/strong&gt;  I put alot of effort into Steam and all its workings. Whether it is checking up on the Reddit Steam group or putting up screenshots from my games. I am always connected and I think that helps with moderator. Its important to know everything going on with Steam if you are gonna moderate a subreddit for it. I am in the Steam Client beta so Im always getting the 4 or 5 updates a week.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Kuiper:&lt;/strong&gt;  One of the recent additions to Steam has been the new badge and trading card feature, which allows you to craft badges which, among other things, increase the number of slots on your friends list. I&amp;#39;ve heard many people remark that this is a somewhat &amp;quot;useless feature,&amp;quot; because the old friends list limit was 250, which according to some should be more than enough slots for everyone. However, the ability to expand the friend list beyond 250 users certainly wasn&amp;#39;t a trivial feature for me; for at least a year now I&amp;#39;ve been constantly having to prune my list to keep it below the 250 mark, and having the ability to add friend slots is certainly a welcome addition. I recently purchased several cards to complete a summer sale badge solely for the sake of adding extra slots to my friends list. Some people would say that this makes me a &amp;quot;power user&amp;quot; of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Which are your favourite games on steam ? how good are you ? ;)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;timbro1:&lt;/strong&gt;  Currently I have been playing a lot of Dota 2. I am also getting into Kerbal Space Program. I&amp;#39;ve also sunk way too many hours into Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;dihydrogen_monoxide:&lt;/strong&gt;  I don&amp;#39;t really have a favorite, but my most enjoyable experiences have been Mirrors Edge, Cave Story, Dota 2, and Gemini Rue. I play mostly adventure games.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Cheesydude:&lt;/strong&gt;  Age of Empires II: HD edition is my #2 played game on steam (surpassed only by TF2), it&amp;#39;s one of my favourite games of all time and my playtime (290 hours) shows that for sure. I&amp;#39;m sorely awaiting them to get their own steam trading cards, so I can pimp up my steam profile AoE style.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Reiniger:&lt;/strong&gt;  Favorites games would have to be Dota 2 hands done. Im kinda TC 8P&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Kuiper:&lt;/strong&gt;  Valve&amp;#39;s multiplayer games are the reason that I started using Steam in the first place, and they continue to be the main driving factor for my continued use of it\u2014the reason that I found myself hitting the old friends list limit is that I have groups of friends for pretty much every multiplayer Valve game, since they&amp;#39;re all team-based games that are best enjoyed with people you know and play with regularly. My first Steam obsession was Counter-Strike, which I played fanatically until late 2007, when I got sucked into Team Fortress 2. After playing the TF2 for several hundred hours in pubs servers and getting bored with it, I started getting involved in competitive TF2. I wrote for a site called Community Fortress, and played in several low-level competitive leagues like TWL and CEVO-A, but eventually as updates became more and more frequent I found myself less and less able to muster the motivation to keep up with the game. I ended up quitting the game around half a year before it went free-to-play.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy latest kick is Dota 2. I started playing in January 2013, and since then I&amp;#39;ve played around 350 games. When you consider that an average Dota 2 game will usually last around 40 minutes, that&amp;#39;s certainly quite a bit of playtime over the past few months! That said, despite that the non-trivial amount of time I&amp;#39;ve invested in Dota 2, I don&amp;#39;t consider anywhere close to being a high-level player, and I&amp;#39;m still constantly improving and learning new strategies. That&amp;#39;s one of the things that I love about Dota 2! Also, while I&amp;#39;m on the subject of subreddits that I moderate, I have to throw in a plug for &lt;a href=\"/r/learndota2\"&gt;/r/learndota2&lt;/a&gt;, a beginner-friendly subreddit for those learning the complex game that is Dota 2; if you&amp;#39;re a new player looking to break in, feel free to stop by and get answers to any questions that you may have, no matter how basic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;timbro1:&lt;/strong&gt;  I would like to thank all of the Redditors who are helpful to other people and contribute to make the community better.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;dihydrogen_monoxide:&lt;/strong&gt;  Shout-out to the subreddit regulars, without you folks, we&amp;#39;d be inundated with questions like &amp;quot;How Steam I do?&amp;quot; For future subscribers, please read the sidebar! We have a fairly fleshed out FAQ section, as well as certain guidelines when making a submission.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Cheesydude:&lt;/strong&gt;  Please make use of the wiki and sidebar before posting - there&amp;#39;s an abundance of useful information contained there, it&amp;#39;s well worth a read.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Reiniger:&lt;/strong&gt;  Gotta thank everybody that contributes to the subreddit, it really makes our job easier when everyone gets involved. It was a great Summer Sale for us on the subreddit. We saw some record traffic which was cool. Gotta piggyback some of my other moderators in saying to make use of the sidebar an wiki because there is tons of info there that will answer your questions.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Kuiper:&lt;/strong&gt;  It&amp;#39;s okay to not like things, but I think people might be happier and have more fun if they spent less time talking about the things that they don&amp;#39;t like and more time doing the things that they do like. At the same time, it&amp;#39;s also okay for other people to not like things, including the things that you happen to like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have an awesome week ahead everyone! :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "#/r/Steam \n\n**73,341 gamers since 4 years!**\n\nFor those who dont know, [steam](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/Square_Steam_Logo.png) is like a platform software by valve where one can buy many games, interact with friends for multiplayer games thus giving one a common arena for accessing his/her games.

I ended up quitting the game around half a year before it went free-to-play.  \nMy latest kick is Dota 2. I started playing in January 2013, and since then I've played around 350 games. When you consider that an average Dota 2 game will usually last around 40 minutes, that's certainly quite a bit of playtime over the past few months! That said, despite that the non-trivial amount of time I've invested in Dota 2, I don't consider anywhere close to being a high-level player, and I'm still constantly improving and learning new strategies. That's one of the things that I love about Dota 2! Also, while I'm on the subject of subreddits that I moderate, I have to throw in a plug for /r/learndota2, a beginner-friendly subreddit for those learning the complex game that is Dota 2; if you're a new player looking to break in, feel free to stop by and get answers to any questions that you may have, no matter how basic.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;##5. Do you have anything to say to your present and future subscribers ?  \n&gt;&gt;**timbro1:**  I would like to thank all of the Redditors who are helpful to other people and contribute to make the community better.  \n**dihydrogen_monoxide:**  Shout-out to the subreddit regulars, without you folks, we'd be inundated with questions like \"How Steam I do?\" For future subscribers, please read the sidebar! We have a fairly fleshed out FAQ section, as well as certain guidelines when making a submission.  \n**Cheesydude:**  Please make use of the wiki and sidebar before posting - there's an abundance of useful information contained there, it's well worth a read.  \n**Reiniger:**  Gotta thank everybody that contributes to the subreddit, it really makes our job easier when everyone gets involved. It was a great Summer Sale for us on the subreddit. We saw some record traffic which was cool. Gotta piggyback some of my other moderators in saying to make use of the sidebar an wiki because there is tons of info there that will answer your questions.  \n**Kuiper:**  It's okay to not like things, but I think people might be happier and have more fun if they spent less time talking about the things that they don't like and more time doing the things that they do like. At the same time, it's also okay for other people to not like things, including the things that you happen to like.\n\n\nHave an awesome week ahead everyone! :D\n", "likes": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "1kh37u", "clicked": false, "stickied": false, "title": "August 16th, 2013. /r/Steam.
